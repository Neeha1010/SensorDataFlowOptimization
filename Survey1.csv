and even if the authorities think about this then they should go for co-ed hostels.

-If girls have privacy then boys also want to live freely. equality is for all, if allowing girls in boys hostel then think about boys in girls hostel also.

In other colleges, people study together, make projects together, have fun together irrespective of their gender. But situation in our college is bit different, people have their study groups, project groups, friends but when it comes to hostels, sitting together, discussing stuff, playing games, our college lacks space. Hostels can be utilised as efficient workplaces and discussion grounds, many of us like to study and work from the comfort or our rooms.
Also, this will help in interpersonal development, and how to handle things with people in general, and not based on gender.
This will also reduce the gender gap which can be seen in our institute.

Also i would suggest something, almost all of us are mature enough to understand the responsibility, but there must be some limitations, like in housing societies, if we want to visit someone, they first inform the  host, so please allow only those guests to braeg who are invited by someone. No one wants thier doors to be slammed by people. Specially from other hostels.

No space available for projects and rooms would serve as a quite and comfortable place for everyone to work in and thus would serve to encourage creativity.
It is 2022 and we are still living with the archaic notion that girls and boys are to be separated. However it is time tested that a hand of authority has never been the solution to anything, specially to people who are older than 18 years old and are able to distinguish the bad from the good.

For most people writing no because of privacy issues. It is absurd if you roam around the hostel half naked and call it a breach in privacy."

Girls are already in minority and face the issues of getting neglected in a group project or discussion as the majority are boys and they prefer doing the same in their hostel rooms and thus girls get left behind. Also the classrooms are crowded and not comfortable for discussion as others get disturbed. We have to treat classrooms like ""library"" since we don't have one. 
Other reason include the fact that it is not an open atmosphere and disturbing thought process of people that ""girls should abide by the boundaries defined by the society"". And these boundaries can also be just being friends an opposite gender. 
Previously the entry was allowed and we are asking of the rights that once our seniors had and now we don't. 
The fact that this topic has become so fragile and a taboo to discuss reflects the narrow mindedness of the people.

Cons freedom to roam around freely will be completely distorted. We are so used to roaming around without shirts/t-shirts. The bathrooms are way away from the rooms how are we supposed to got have a bath if we might just find some girl in the corridor. Take away so much of my liberty. 
Solution:- change your clothes  in the bathroom itself. 
Create a common room where girls and boys can meet and have their discussion "

One sided rules should not be made and a healthy discussion on this matter among students and faculty should be encouraged. 
It is much better if girls would be allowed taking care of proper protocols, like entries, time restrictions etc. "
